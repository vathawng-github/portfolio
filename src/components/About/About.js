                        <p className="desc">üëã Hey there! I'm Van Bawi, a passionate web developer with a knack for turning ideas into digital reality. My journey in the world of coding began when I started my degree in Web Development at IUPUI. Over the years, I've honed my skills in MERN stack applications, UX / UI Design, and I thrive on tackling challenging projects that push my creative and technical boundaries. <br /><br />
                        
                        üöÄ Whether it's crafting responsive and user-friendly interfaces or diving into the backend to optimize performance, I love the dynamic nature of web development. I've had the privilege of working on numerous projects in school and internships, where I both developed and designed user friendly and visually appealing applications with the latest web technologies. <br /><br/>

                        üåê Outside of coding, you'll likely find me exploring the latest web development / design trends, experimenting with new technologies, or engaging with the vibrant tech community. I'm all about continuous learning and staying updated with the ever-evolving web landscape. <br /><br />
